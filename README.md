# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This application is an elegant solution for searching for a recipe based on the userâ€™s local temperature. Users can search for main ingredients and the application will return a list of recipes appropriate for the current temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing, the app will return more soups, baked goods, casseroles, and comfort foods. If it is very warm outside, more grillable foods, cold salads and blended beverages will appear. 


## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user installs jest and inquirer the user should be able to build an employee team with a manager, engineers and interns.  

## Usage
The usage was to continue building our skills wit node.js and using the terminal. The we also had to use the following resources: [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.
