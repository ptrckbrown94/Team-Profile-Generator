# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
This application is an elegant solution for searching for a recipe based on the userâ€™s local temperature. Users can search for main ingredients and the application will return a list of recipes appropriate for the current temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing, the app will return more soups, baked goods, casseroles, and comfort foods. If it is very warm outside, more grillable foods, cold salads and blended beverages will appear. 


## Installation 
If all the files are kept in a single fold and the user has an internet connection they should be able to use the application.  

## Usage
The usage was for our group to practice our CSS, HTML, and Javascript skills. We also had to use two different apis that we did not use in class and could not use Bootstrap styling. 

## Credit
We created this project from the outline given to us by our Triology Education Services instructor. We also took code from our homework and in class activities. Paul Hendrickson helped come up with the idea of having an application use weather data to help pick recipes. We have also cited other sources within our Javascript, HTLM and CSS.  

## Contributing 
We built this application with our assigned group, Jake O'Toole, Mary Jacobs, Mark McGraw and Patrick Brown. We also had help from our instructor and TAs.
